- 👋 Dear passengers from the programming universe, my name is Ivo Rodrigues and I have been a developer for over 20 years.
I have extensive experience with the TOTVS PROTHEUS ERP since it's implementation and automation.
- 👀 I'm interested in sharing information about the TOTVS PROTHEUS environment and also learning a little about typescript-based languages.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning Flutter, Angular and no-code Outsystems.
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on projects in Flutter or Angular to increase my knowledge in the languages.
- 📫 I am available for contact via email: ivo.rodrigues@vreisconsult.com.br.
